# PROJECT DOCUMENTATION FOR MY DEBTOR

## Project Overview

This platform is a web-based application that allows schools in a certain locality to list a directory of people owing them. This is to help them avoid going to other schools/ establishments to meet their debtors.
This application helps to create a platform whereby names of debtors of school fees database can be inputted and monitored by owners/administrators of schools. This will also check/avoid students who have pending debts from moving to other schools without clearing those debts.

## Project features

- Registration process
- Documentation about debtors
- Basic information about the platform
- Verification of details
- Comments from other users
- Input new information about debtors
- Information about users
- A statistical representation of information
- Allow debtors to challenge - contend

## Potential Users( target audience)

The target audience of this product is the owners, stakeholders, principal administrators of schools and parents/guidians of the students.

## Project Deliverables

- Design sketch
- Low-fidelity prototype
- High-fidelity prototype

## Project goals

The following listed below are the project goals of this project:

- Authentication of genuine users.
- For schools to have a database of debtors and a monitoring system.
- To check parents/guardians who remove their wards from schools they're owing and put them in another.
- To allow debtors to contend with proofs.

## Deliverables

- Low fidelity wireframe
- High fidelity wireframes

## Design Process

**I. empathize** is stage where we put ourselves in the shoes of the audience we want to create a product for, at this stage imagining and sharing into their pain points would give us a broader perspective on how to solve their problems.

**ii. Define:** the problem is the debtors of school fees that remove their wards from one school to another within their locality, thinking they have escaped the responsibility of not paying for the service used. There is also the problem of admins recording the name of a parent or guardian who paid completely for the fee and for some reasons the record cant be found on the school system, there is avenue for them to defend themselves with evidence.

**iii. Ideate:** My Debtors is an idea that solves this problem

**Iv. in the prototype stage:** design sketches would be employed to analyze the proper places to put elements that would solve the problem, then to low fidelity wireframes to the final high fidelity wireframe that would represent the real-life simulation of what the actual product will look like.

**User Personal**
A. **Mrs Kaladaju** is a proprietress of a primary school in her locality, she isn't making enough money to pay her staff well, and this is due to the high rate of parents and guardians owing her organization money. As she was taking inventory of all her students, she noticed a pattern of children who are owing school fees no longer attending her school but are now going to another school not so far from hers.

**Pain points/Frustrations:**

- No money to pay staff
- Parents/guardiance are owing the school
- Students that are owed withdraw from her school to attend another school not far from hers.

**Goals:**

- Provide a platform she can track the students that have paid for school fees/ other fees and those who are owing.
- Provide a platform she can update the list of debtors.

B. **Mr Fatai** is a 45-year-old married man who caters for 3 children in school. He works in Ministry of Works, Abuja, FCT. While he claimed to have finished paying the children's school fees, he has been accused of owing the school.
